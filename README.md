# My Game of life

A simple an minimaly interactive python implemenation of Conway's Game of Life.

### Requirements:
Make sure you have installed numpy as well as tkinter. Sadly installing tkinter to a venv seems quiet difficult. Therefore, I didn't create a venv for this project.

### Usage:
To start the simulation simply press any key. To manually create new alive cells or to delete alive cells, simply click on the corresponding cell.

Have fun!
